# JavaFxApplications
My JavaFx Applications.

Hey there,

As we know, JavaFX is a software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications, as well as rich internet applications (RIAs) that can run across a wide variety of devices. 

This repository contains some of the JavaFx applications which I built using IntelliJ Idea as the IDE and Oracle SceneBuilder 2.0 for building the .fxml file.

Note: I've used Lambda Expressions here (ie Java 1.8 is required).
