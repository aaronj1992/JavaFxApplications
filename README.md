# JavaFxApplications
My JavaFx Applications.

Hey there,

As we know, **JavaFX** is a software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications, as well as rich internet applications (RIAs) that can run across a wide variety of devices. 

This repository contains some of the JavaFx applications which I built using **IntelliJ Idea** as the IDE and **Oracle SceneBuilder 2.0** for building the .fxml file.

Note: I've used Lambda Expressions here (ie Java 1.8 is required).

##Contents

* **Student Management Application** - This application simply helps to add all the details of students in a format. After entering the data, the user can save the data. The application will save the data in the form of a text file.

* **BMI Application** - This application simply calculates the BMI by taking the inputs from the user. The application also gives out a remark based on user's BMI. If the user wishes to save the data then he/she can do so. The application will save the data in the form of a text file alongwith the current date and time.
